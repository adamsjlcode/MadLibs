# Madlibs Project

 If you've never played Mad Libs before, here's how it generally works.
One person holds a story that contains blanks, each with a suitable part of speech written under it. They ask a friend to supply them with words that match each parts of speech, without letting that friend see the story, writing the words onto the blanks as they go. When they get to the end, they read they're ridiculous creation aloud.
